            Gmail App Password is required because:
            - **2-Factor Authentication**: If you have 2FA enabled on your Google account
            - **Security**: Regular passwords don't work with third-party applications
            - **Access Control**: App passwords provide limited, revocable access

            ✅ **Google Account with 2-Step Verification enabled**  
            ✅ **Access to your Google Account settings**
